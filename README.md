Frantic Shooter

Game flow is quite simple : 

- Tap on the screen and it starts. 
- Char starts shooting through boxes
- After certain thresholds upgrade popups appear and weapons can be upgraded that way
- After certain thresholds there are gates put into the levels and you access new weapons through them.
- You shoot with those guns until the game over.

To change weapon settings : 
Go to Resources --> Config --> Weapon --> Choose any weapon you like and change it's configurations.

To change level settings : 
I'm using prefab to manipulate positons of gates or extending path or changing update points by level finish rate, so you're also welcome to do same.

Almost everything's getting loaded via Resources API and almost everything runs on Extenject (Zenject) structure. You are highly encouraged to ask questions related to it.
I like to talk about improvements and software architecture overall.

Enjoy the game, and hire me!
